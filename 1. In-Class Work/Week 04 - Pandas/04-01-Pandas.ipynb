    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is by far the most commonly used primary Python tool for data analysis. It offers many tools for working with all kinds of data, and many packages are even built around the pandas tools. If you have worked with R before in another class, you are probably familiar with data frames. Pandas offers a DataFrame class of objects that has very similar properties to R data frames and will be the main method of storing tabular data (data with rows and columns).\n",
