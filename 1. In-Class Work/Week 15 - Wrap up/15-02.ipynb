    "## What is reproducibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, reproducibility, or reproducible research, means that the work that you have done can be reproduced by others. Though the idea might seem simple, it can actually take quite a bit of work. However, it is well worth doing, because the benefits of reproducible research can be vast. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why reproducibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and foremost reason that we want to emphasize reproducibility in science is because that's simply how science should be done. It is important that the work that you do be verifiable so that others can confirm your work. It lends much more credibility to your work to have all of your code easily accessible, because it isn't being obfuscated or hidden. The overall practice of reproducible research also means that you can go in and see what others have done to confirm and refute their findings. It also helps others build on the work that you've done and allows for more efficient collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making sure that your work is reproducible can be very helpful for you too. Going back to your work after a break is much easier if you practice reproducible research strategies. Code is much easier to read and the workflow is much clearer when you follow these strategies."

    "## How do you *practice* reproducible research?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to make sure that your work is reproducible is something we have already been doing throughout this class already: using Jupyter notebooks! More specifically, using Jupyter notebooks in conjunction with the cloud environment means that we can share our work and know that someone else can run the code we used and get the same result. In our classes, this is useful for me to be able to share code and show step by step what is going on within a specific process. Jupyter also allows me to provide descriptions in narrative text in Markdown cells along with the code in code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE FOR FINAL PROJECT**: These are all techniques you should be employing in your final projects as well! Make sure you describe what is going on within your code, and follow the proper practice of making sure that I can reproduce what you are doing if I were to run your code!\n",

    "## Version Control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "One common method for implementing transparency and improving workflows in coding projects is **version control**. Version control is the practice of tracking changes to code over time. You can think of it similar to how Google Docs keeps track of any changes that you make within its history. With version control, you can look back at previous version of your work, see the progress as you add or change things, and even revert back if a change wasn't desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a version control system that is widely used for coding projects. Working with Git involves setting up a **repository** and tracking files within that repository as you make changes. You can then easily make updates or revert changes within that repository with a few commands. It's like saving multiple versions of the same file, except you don't need to have different files for each of them. \n",

    "### GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub (https://github.com) is a commonly used as the **remote repository**. A remote repository is just a repository that is stored somewhere else besides your own local computer or workspace. Typically, a remote repository like GitHub is used to share your work with others and/or make it publicly available. This is most helpful when you are collaborating with others, because you can make changes to a project and others who have access to the remote repository would then be able to see those changes without needing to have access to what you have on your own workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Git Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initialize a git repository** This creates a git repository so that you can start tracking files in the repository.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    git clone <remote repo>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Make changes and/or add files** Just adding files or making changes to files in the repository folder isn't enough to track them! You need to add the changes or files so that they are tracked. \n",
    "\n",
    "    git add <filename>\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Step 3: Commit changes** This creates a checkpoint of all the changes you have made so far. Typically, you add, then commit any adds you have made. \n",
    "\n",
    "    git commit\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Step 4: Push changes to remote repository** If you have a remote repository, you then push those changes so that the remote repository is the same as your local repository.\n",
