That is, the **unit of observation** is a person and the variables all describe that person. We've also looked at data where the unit of observation was a US state. However, this is not always the case. You need to be careful and think through exactly what each row represents, and transform your data if it needs to be in another form. Let's take the merged anxiety and Census data as an example. This is available in the `anxiety_census_data.csv` file, and contains the proportion of people who reported feeling anxious all or most of the last 7 days within each state for a series of days from May 1, 2022 to June 25, 2022.
