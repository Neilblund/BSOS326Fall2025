I’m hopeful her policies will promote actual help for the middle class not some trickle-down economics that keep the rich rich and the poor poor. (Things like capping Insulin prices.) The rich don’t share their money- look at the crazy gains CEO’s and businesses have made. Their percentage of growth is insane compared to the gains of the middle class and poor!! She is super pro-choice and articulates so well what that is and means for women, men, and our country! She represents hope and a bright future for my daughters and all of America’s daughters!! She is energetic and can promote hope and excitement. She works hard in the face of adversity and is a strong woman who sees a bigger picture than Trump. She’s not a pathological liar. She’s not for violence. She feels like more of a protector. A protector of people and our nation.","I won’t vote against her, but I do have concerns about the state of California and the fact that she played a role in the governing of that state.

He claims his policies help the middle class, but they don’t. They help the rich, business owners. He lies like a rug!! I get that not all politicians are honest to a T, but Trump lies so much you can’t believe anything he says- anything! He says he wants to protect our border and while there are major problems w/ immigration, why he didn’t he fix it when he was our president! Having a big deportation party once he is elected comes across as callous and inhumane. The immigrants I personally know who are here illegally, are hard workers only hoping for basic human rights. There has to be a better solution to immigration and we need RATIONAL, compassionate, and realistic leaders to address that issue, not hate-filled, selfish, bigoted, rich men who have no idea what life is like for poor in other countries. The biggest issue however is Abortion and Female reproductive rights! Trump is not for women or their freedom and I truly believe, given his track record, that he will allow the Supreme Court and other bad actors to walk back women’s rights. I have daughters and will be voting for their futures, period!! Trumps legal issues and the words that spill from his mouth are disgustingly disturbing. I can’t believe I actually voted for him in 2016!!","Taking steps backward on women's rights and freedoms.

Every true follower / believer in Jesus Christ as their Saviour is to stand for Israel.  I am not against any race; I am against terrorists.  I am for Trump based on his record of his first 4-years in office; he did great, critical things for America.  Biden/Harris team have hurt America on many levels.  I am for Trump because of his stand on having immigrants go through the standard, legal American process to immigrate to our country.  It is sad there needed to be a WALL, but fact-finding shows terrorists, child - trafficking, illegal drugs, and illegals entering from China and terrorist orgs in the Middle East have entered to harm Americans and America.  These facts and extreme, stupid numbers are the reason I am for the Wall.  I am for the USA drilling oil that we have here, and as I understand, we have many, many years to drill here.  Stop making deals with the Middle East for oil that benefits those people, our evil administration driving this and making deals which benefits our administration - and NOT the American people.  Moving toward our financial stability - it grew rapidly under Trump - and went negative for the last 3 1/2 years with Harris and Biden.  I work full-time like many/most US citizens and I want the MAGA economy back.  Biden/Harris could have continued with the good that Trump orchestrated, grew, and maintained; but, they changed the good immediately.  Why?  I still know no reason.  I believe it was to turn people against Trump.  Also, it seems Trump - at his worst that anyone with truth can say about him - is by FAR the lesser of two evils for the 2024 election.  I am pro-Life.  I understand if a mother's life is in danger of survival during birth, a choice for life has to be made in some situations.  I am emotionally and physically sickened to hear during the DNC that Walz is for abortion to the point of birth, and Harris's long-term stance of not believing in the rights of life for all people - babies.  Yet, she now broadcasts she will be a president for all people.  How?  She has a track-record that shows the opposite.  She is broadcasting what she will do as president and each thing is opposite of her opportunity the last 3 1/2 years.  She greatly exaggerates her accomplishments as DA and work prior to being VP in 2020.  I was and still am disguested at her performance at the recent debate earlier this week.  It almost seemed as if she knew what questions would be asked and in what order they'd be asked; she has NEVER EVER been witnessed to be so fluent and confident in her responses as this past Tuesday's debate - EVER in her past offices.  Even those not for Trump have commented that the moderators showed clear bias.  Harris never answered even the first question of the debate to her; and this continued without the moderators bringing the question back.  Two-thirds to half-way through her memorization, she began shooting out of her mouth the 'LIAR' word over and over.  Not worthy of even a lower level of office conduct - way below being in the white house.  [CHAR(10)]She was not fact-checked.  Trump if for The Blue; he did not tear apart our police force like Walz in Minnesota situations OR Biden and Harris.  Harris went along with ALL as VP.  Who in the world can listen to her promises NOW after what she has stood for in her most recent role for 3 1/2 years?  I feel the media and fake news and unfair treatment of any negative report of the Biden/Harris Pelosi Schumer group actions gets escalated and whoever it is against them somehow gets silenced, gets targeted, gets untrue things said against them plus simply hides their actions in the dark.  Just like Zuckerberg was asked to not allow freedom of speech during covid.  Fauci's broadcasting of untrue, un-tested proclamations.  Any opponent against the 2020 team gets taken out, gets critically damaged with the intent to take them out.  Buying votes - I am very concerned that those against Trump's advancement or being treated decently/truthfully are buying votes by allowing the outrageous number of illegals into our country.  Those entering are not just impoverished people/races.  This is very concerning.  This is EVIL.  Was the 2020 voting process handled as it should have been?  Was there fraud?  I saw the 'Mule' report.  It seemed real.  I am concerned about the 2024 election process.  Any Party that is pushing for a person with no valid/verifiable ID being allowed to vote is going against our election process that has stood strong for ?? number of years.  Like this, there are many topics of normal standards/rules that are being overlooked, changed, pushed down with the media being silent on these things to support the Democrats or those in charge during this term - however we want to say this, OR the media is broadcasting topics to get the American people off-track of our rights, the Constitution, how we were founded and how we became the greatest country in the world.  We are not that now after 3 1/2 years of Harris and Biden.  I will stop - but there are many more reasons I have FOR TRUMP and against the evil of Harris, and of the current group in office.",NA,"News media swayed to a political party or group.  Published or stated info that is broadcast needs to be fact-checked OR open to chargeable offense when untrue, and damaging untruth.This needs to be stopped.  Many Americans do not check themselves on what they hear.  Abortion to birth, as the Harris/Walz party stated in their campaign.  Gross.  If a women becomes 'emotional' in the last months of her pregnancy, she should kill the growing baby?  Unthinkable.   Elected officials and their families profiting from liaisons with others and other countries.  Example:  Biden and his family with China, Biden and Hunter with Russia, Pelosi.  Elected senators and Reps should be charged/jailed/fined for personally profiting $$.  This is not the reason we pay taxes.  I'm out of time.",0,100

That is only one of many things that I don’t like about Donald Trump. I don’t understand how someone who has been convicted of tax fraud and sexual assault would even be considered a valid candidate for president. I am astonished and confused that roughly 40% of America thinks that it’s OK to belittle and demean people at any time but especially on national television. I am confused and bewildered that people mindlessly follow Trump yet he cannot give accurate fax and statistics to back up why he thinks he’s a good candidate for president. I don’t understand how there are not laws blocking someone who tried to falsely take over an election from becoming president. Trump is a direct threat to America; he is a direct threat to freedom. Everything he stands for is so self-serving that he will allow any corrupt government or group lead him astray as long as it benefits him. We are on the precipice of revolution. The 1% has pushed us too far.

She seems to be committed to being economically progressive (she's talking about taking on big banks, supporting social security, etc.) as well as doing a good job of attacking republicans on the social issues that they're weak on (abortion). I also really like her VP candidate Tim Walz. I think Kamala picking Walz is really savvy because I feel like in many past elections they would've picked Shapiro or Buttigieg or another person that the Democratic Party leaders liked but Democratic voters don't care for. One thing about many democrats is their policy is clearly better than republicans but they don't actually accomplish it. By her picking Walz (a man who was able to accomplish his policy despite a narrow grip on the legislature) I think she showed a lot of competence herself and commitment to actually doing things if possible.","I'd never vote for a republican but I also have some hesitations about voting for someone if they refuse to take a stand against the genocide that Israel is committing. Kamala has called for a ceasefire and in the past has supported a two state solution but it worries me that when she was interrupted at her rally, she didn't have a prepared response the first time (the second time she did). It makes it seem like it's not really the case that she's fighting for a ceasefire but is rather content to let the slaughter keep happening and potentially drag us into a war vs Iran. I wouldn't vote for a conservative ever but I don't know if I would want to vote for a candidate if November comes around and it looks like the Biden/Harris presidency is letting this happen and leading us into a potential war with Iran.",NA,"His policy is terrible.

Most of these foreign students coming here (based on visa luck and showing fake bank account to US consultancy office) and doing master's and putting fake experience in their resume and grabbing the jobs, through consultancy agencies. Mostly these consultancy agencies are on salary commission bases and encouraging the foreign MS students to create the fake resume and through their hierarchy channel (consultancy friends) in that companies, they are helping this foreign MS students getting the jobs, which BADLY hurting the USA citizens jobs opportunities. THIS MUST be stopped immediately.   The people who running these consultancy agencies in USA, came from villages landlords or corrupt officers/politician/film industries, and mostly they are having religious background people and hurting the Chirstian minorities back in India (for example).  After getting the commissioned money from MS students, these consultancy agencies are doing real estate here in USA and increasing the home price and looting people here in USA.  They (consultancies) are helping by running parallel economy in USA to help corrupted politician back in India.   The best solution for this problem is 1.scrutinize the education background while giving visa. 2. NO off campus jobs (doing in consultancies motels/restaurants) 3. directly hire them through USA company with reasonable salary (where consultancy charging 10 time higher).  4. if these MS students are too good, provide green card to them without delay.   In this way, it will not hurt USA citizens jobs, mostly they complete their studies with bank loans, and they are able to repay that money if they have jobs in hand.   It only possible when US government set down fake consultancy business, in that way US government helping (1) the right-minded (knowledge) MS students for jobs and preventing them from slavery, (2) helping the innocent people not to fall in consultancy real estate fake business, and (3) back in India, helping the Christian minorities to practice their religious with freedom. (4) IRS will get tax money by prevent parallel running economy by this consultancy for corrupted politicians back in India. Here I taken India as example.

I'm not very confident she would actually do any of these things, and I think there is a high chance she will sell out to the highest bidder, but she's somewhat more likely to do more good than Trump.  Of course, she's a heck of a lot less likely to do categorically bad things, like attacking reproductive rights, than Trump is.","There's a pretty high chance that she will advance policies that make her Wall Street and corporate donors richer at the expense of the American people. She may take a less aggressive anti-trust stance than the Biden administration has - for example, she may fire Lina Khan, as some of her major donors like Reid Hoffman have asked her to do. There's also a high chance that she won't be nearly aggressive enough in using governmental power to fix urgent problems facing the country - lack of housing near jobs, out-dated and inefficient transportation infrastructure, out-of-control-costs of education, weak industrial output, bureaucratic bloat and inefficiency in government agencies, agriculture policies that lead to a fragile and unhealthy food supply chain while inflicting unsustainable environmental damage on soil and waterways, and weak food and drug safety regulations, to name a few. She also may well do little to fix immigration policy and enforcement, cultivating a system that encourages people to break or skirt the rules, while leaving people who do follow the rules feeling cheated, and creates a pool of easy-to-exploit labor that keeps wages down, and corporate profit margins up (a lot of her donors probably like the status quo and don't want her to change anything). She also doesn't seem very likely to end U.S. support for Israel.","He seems likely to do more to help revive American manufacturing and industrial production, such imposing stronger tariffs on imports, particularly from China, and being less naively enthusiastic about international free trade in general. He also may be more likely to improve immigration policy - perhaps streamlining legal immigration while cracking down on illegal immigration - though if he also might just make theatrical gestures to his base while not making any meaningful changes.",I'll never vote for him because of his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.

Currently Harris has a foreign policy adviser Phil Gordon who has some questionable ties to Iran, according to the Iranian dissident press Iran International. President Biden had strong and clear positions that were well-informed by decades of history and policy making, but VP Harris does not have the same experience, leading to poor decisions.",NA,"Trump is a criminal and has been for the past decades with refusal to pay contractors, ties to mafia, probable money laundering, and loans from shady characters around the world including the most recently discovered $10 million illegal campaign donation from Egypt. He takes bribes and gives bribes, and he appointed SCOTUS justices that legalized acts that have always been considered bribery. His SCOTUS justices also overturned Chevron deference, creating chaos in the federal regulations, and Roe vs. Wade, creating chaos in women's health care including for women with wanted pregnancies that cause unforeseen problems. He says openly that he will destroy democracy, and he already has tried with the fake elector scheme and January 6 attempted coup that aimed at killing his VP and the Speaker of the House, the next two in the order of succession. He separated children from parents and some families have still not been reunited. He wants to deport >11 million people, which will lead to massive human rights violations and deprive agriculture sector from needed labor which will increase food prices; there's good reason that Reagan gave amnesty despite opposing undocumented immigration. He aims to take down NATO and other crucial elements of the global order that maintain peace. He is consistently deferential to US enemy Putin for unknown reasons, and he will allow large parts of Ukraine to be taken over by Russia, which will lead to Russia's further invasions of Baltics and Poland. He promised a few potentially beneficial policies in his 2016-20 presidency and did almost nothing. Everyone who defies Trump gets death threats from his followers, and numerous people are in personal danger for defying him, including former Republican party leader Mitt Romney, which is a Stalinesque situation. Trump called for Republicans to vote against the bipartisan border bill that gave them almost everything they wanted in order to maximize the challenges at the border so that Republicans can run on that.",Iran's fundamentalist government getting a nuclear weapon,85,0

A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for aristocracy, chaos, and revenge. I have been a staunch Republican for [REDACTED NUMBER] years and have only voted once for a democrat in the second general election once before in 1972 when I voted for George McGovern rather than Richard Nixon because I had a nagging feeling that President Nixon was a liar and a crook. However, my [REDACTED FAMILY MEMBER] voted for Nixon in 1972 and then, just months later, he was ousted because of his Watergate coverup. I feel that Donald Trump is a very dangerous man and could easily run our democratic nation into ruin and chaos. In my opinion, Donald Trump is much more dangerous than Richard Nixon was in 1972. In addition, just the fact alone that Mr. Trump wants to bring Liz Cheney before a military tribunal if he is elected is rubbish. Liz Cheney is no different than myself in that we are both life-long republicans who have been betrayed by Mr. Trump and the GOP. I served in the [REDACTED MILITARY BRANCH] during the [REDACTED CONFLICT]. Mr. Trump knows nothing about the military or military service. The military, to Mr. Trump, is merely a vehicle to be used for his own personal retribution against anyone who stands up to him and dares to call him out.

People who will assist him in his revenge against the DOJ for filing felony charges against him for his illegal and outrageous behaviors in January of 2021 and revenge against the FBI for raiding his Mara-a-Lago Club in search of absconded classified documents he had stashed away there. Because the Supreme Court has granted Mr. Trump full immunity for ""all official acts"" during his upcoming term in office, he now has no guard rails in place to check his promise of revenge against his ""enemies."" With the nomination of people like Pete Hegseth as the Secretary of Defense and Kash Patel as the Director of the FBI, Mr. Trump now has a clear and unindictable pathway to the end of the ""Rule of Law"" as we know it today and his accomplishment of his primary mandate to become a dictator.

The left is more adamant that all American cultures and things America does it the worst thing in the world. The right hates where America is going and honestly more anti-American because they are willing to overthrow the government in order to put their leader into power because of the mere mention that it could have been a hoax when there was no significant evidence to show the voting in 2020 was bad. There is a huge divide in the country right now and we cannot come together to fight for America as a whole, every side claims the other is anti-American and in a sense they are both right. I think that if some country were to invade us right now (this would never happen but most likely would be Russia or China) the right or left would abandon the country because they would think the invaders have every right to invade us because we are such a bad entity in the world and how America is the worst thing ever.

I like that Kamala (as far as I've seen) doesn't seem crass or rude, or have histories of sexual infidelity or crime. She could be more of a role model for people.[CHAR(10)]","Voting for the Democratic Ticket means expanding Federal Government, increasing expenditures and taxes, and weakening state government. I think this country is too large to be run effectively and representatively by a federal government. Definitely within a 2 party system, it seems like the only option is to become more and more polarized and serve smaller and smaller portions of the population, with the rest left to hold their nose and choose whichever is less bad. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Since we will not do away with a Federal government, my dream is to emulate some European countries that have a number of parties that align with much smaller proportions of the country than 50/50. Then these parties will have to make meaningful and effective compromise to reach goals and legislate for a larger proportion of the country. Voting for one of the 2 current big parties feeds their influence instead of weakening it.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Some of the identity politics associated more with the Democrat party concern me. I sympathize with elements of their arguments and disagree with others. I also struggle with balancing my personal beliefs with knowing that a government needs to fairly represent all of its citizens, even those I disagree with.","The Republican Party is the party that I have supported in the past. Overall, the idea of less federal government and leaving decisions to the states appeals to me. The country is too large and varied to paint with a one size fits all brush. States should be able to more effectively tailor their laws to their constituents.","Trump's past crimes, sexual indiscretion, bad language, hateful speech, and more leave a bad taste in my mouth. His claiming to believe in God and the Bible while acting against their guidance paints Christians as hypocritical and hateful. He doesn't need any more of a soapbox than he has already had. I voted for him in 2016 despite this because it seemed less constant then, and I thought Hillary Clinton had similar (though different) concerning features. I chose the esser of 2 evils and I regret this now.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I believe me and my family will personally benefit more from Trump being in office than any other candidate.

She wasn't even voted in. her record as a prosecutor disturbs me. basically I hate everything that comes out of her mouth. I'm not even a political person. I've never really been interested in politics. I cannot stand her I find her to be completely fake. to me she doesn't stand for anything. She would literally go with whatever she's told to go with. Trump on the other hand has actual opinions. and Trump has actual plans whether you think they would work or not. I cannot imagine a worse president for America than Kamala Harris. this is my intuition and has nothing to do with the brainwashed bs media that has taken over giving us nothing but echo Chambers of our own opinions. America's in a very sad state. what the Biden administration did with the border is a disgrace. The way they go after their political opponents is a disgrace. The Democrats used to be the good guys. and now I see them as the worst party.,The fact that he wants to stop illegal immigrants pouring in over the border. I can't just go to any other country I want and live there... this isn't how the world works. The fact that he wants to go after the FDA. The fact that he wouldn't get mowed over by the leaders of other countries. there's many reasons Trump is astoundingly better than Kamala. this is coming from somebody who is not political. I don't care about Republicans I don't care about Democrats. My mind is open and free and not filled with hate for one of the other... and when you're in that mind state you can actually see who is a better candidate. versus looking for confirmation bias. Trump might not be perfect but he actually has plans. where I find the Democrats to not actually have plans and have literally become more corrupt by the second. I have never looked at Republicans and thought that they were better than Democrats until the recent last few years. From my non-political point of view and watching this clown circus I find Republicans to generally be more grounded. I can't believe that I'm saying that but it's true and this is why you see prominent people leaving the Democratic party and supporting Trump at this point.,I really don't like what has happened with the abortion situation. if there were truly an amazing candidate Democratic or not running against Trump I would vote for them. but the Democrats have not put up a viable candidate in a very long time. therefore to me Trump is the top pick by far.,NA,NA,NA

I think it'll hold down individual and companies' growth. Why earn more just to have it taken? There are other ways to increase government funding aside from going after capital gain. Quite a few wealthy people have already figured out how to decrease their taxes by setting up trusts. Why not change the write off policies instead?","A few of the policies he is proposing. One of which he did actually put through earlier when he was President. I was working at a [REDACTED INDUSTRY] at the time.

Within those illegal border crossings, US border patrol reported 172 encounters with people known to be on the Federal Government’s terrorist suspect and associate list.

She shouldn’t have the nomination when no delegates were actually cast in her name. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Regarding her track record as a prosecutor, she has 1) admitted on tape that she abused illegal substances while touting her prosecution of those same substances and 2) pushed progressive ideologies and refused to prosecute as per the Law but based on her personal biases. [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]Her policies are Keynesian. She has proposed a 40% capital gains rate. Currently, the highest capital gains rate is 20%. She has also proposed a capital gains tax on unrealized gains. You cannot tax yourself out of poverty. Such heavy taxation stifles innovation. Inflation is up well above the CPI numbers given because CPI inflation excludes key items from the data set.

She has been unwilling to sit down for an interview and the media has not helped at all with making this a priority.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]All this and more proves that she is NOT for the American people. She is NOT for America and she is NOT a good candidate to lead this country.","We will be voting for Trump not for his personality or morality but for his policies and the leadership structure he wants to install within his administration. The key issues that plagued his administration, (namely the Russia scandal, which lead to his impeachment in the House), turned out to be not only false but falsified. The dossier that we used as the cornerstone piece of evidence to launch the investigation was Was purchased through a law firm with business dealings involving the DNC and the Clinton campaign.

Neither favor nor oppose,"reproductive rights, history as a prosecutor, well respected in her sorority, diverse candidate trying to accomplish something never before accomplished in history","too liberal in her views, does not come off as genuine because she struggles to maintain consistency in her answers, eg. she supports third trimester abortion (even though she will flip and say she doesn’t support that when on a big debate stage), she has supported banning fracking, less US oil drilling, price control, and has a record as VP that is quite frankly deplorable- unemployment and inflation is at an all time high. she supports sending millions of dollars to Lebanon in the middle of the worst hurricane this country has seen- the handling of this devastation by our current left leadership has been despicable - we were personally impacted by this hurricane and her tweet to send $ to Lebanon in light of everything going on was a major “F” you to the southeast.  her comments about Desantis during Hurricane Milton showed she is not a unifying leader and rather she is a politician willing to use crisis to aid her campaign and agenda.  Sadly, she is a woman that doesn’t share the same values as me, does not exemplify a leader that can jar with, compromise and negotiate with global leaders successfully.  The current administration in which she serves has spent entirely too much $ supporting other countries rather than focusing on priorities in our homeland and don’t get me started on immigration and her border czar failure.  I have [REDACTED NUMBER] children.  A vice president that refuses to maintain a safe and secure border, to keep criminals and drug lords out of this country is not the right candidate for President if the US.  Those working at the border endorse Trump.  As a resident of [REDACTED STATE] who has seen firsthand the horrifying consequences of fentanyl, opioids etc in this state, it infuriates me that this administration would tear down the wall, bring in migrants illegally to places like Aurora, Springfield etc.  one of our very own college students in [REDACTED STATE] was murdered by a Venezuelan illegal immigrant while she was out for a run.  and when I read about the Democratic Party bringing in illegal immigrants via plane, giving them rights, housing, food, and things that we don’t even supply our veterans or homeless…it’s enough for me to say …next please.  Tulsi Gabbard should have been the democrat nominee and I prob would have voted for her.  Sadly, democrats didn’t get to vote for their nominee, and Kamala took Joes place in an unprecedented, undemocratic manner.   and lastly- if you have to use a teleprompter for every single thing you do and can’t speak to your people openly and from the heart (or hip)- then you’re not cut out for this job. she is ill equipped","economy- he is running on a record that has proven successful- we paid half the price for groceries during his administration than we do now [CHAR(10)]safety/security- built a wall at border, reduced crime, drug entry. supports legal immigration [CHAR(10)]supports reproductive rights with limits- leans moderate on this which appeals to most Americans who support abortion ti some degree.  he believes abortion law should remain with the states as the Supreme Court ruled. he has said he thinks there should prob be a cutoff in his state of FL of around 15 weeks and also believes in exceptions to the 15 week ban such as lethal fetal anomalies, threat to life of mother.  this falls right in line with what I support.  he is not for a national abortion ban, despite what his opponent touts. he supports IVF.  [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I could go on but these are top 3[CHAR(10)]","he’s obviously full of himself.  some might say a narcissist.  He loves to be grandiose with his words- everything he does is always the best, the greatest and biggest you’ve ever seen.  [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]he did not do well to say he’s the “father of IVF”- eye roll.  [CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]I do believe that he’s too invested and loves this country too much to let it fail.  and so I can overlook his personality flaws just like I would if a surgeon had poor bedside manner but knew what he was doing and had an excellent skill set to perform my operation.  he is the most equipped candidate for this job. and he can negotiate with world leaders and doesn’t give them everything they want.",security and safety of American Citizens,30,75

Her experience in the judicial system and legislative process offers a different perspective compared to Trump's business-oriented background.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]2. **Policy Focus**: Harris has emphasized progressive policies on healthcare, climate change, criminal justice reform, and social equity. Her positions often align with those who prioritize social justice and environmental sustainability.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]3. **Leadership Style**: Harris is seen as a collaborative leader, often advocating for bipartisan efforts and coalition-building. In contrast, Trump’s leadership has been marked by a more confrontational style, which some feel exacerbates divisions.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]4. **Representation**: As the first woman, first Black woman, and first Asian American Vice President, Harris represents a significant step forward for representation in U.S. politics, which can resonate with voters who value diversity in leadership.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]5. **Global Relationships**: Harris's approach to foreign policy has generally emphasized rebuilding alliances and restoring international norms, while Trump's merica First approach often led to strained relationships with traditional allies.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]These points reflect why some might prefer Harris over Trump based on values, leadership style, and policy preferences.",NA,NA,"The impact of Donald Trump becoming U.S. President again would depend on one's perspective and political beliefs. However, here are some potential concerns often raised by critics:[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]1. **Polarization and Division**: Critics argue that Trump's rhetoric and actions have deepened divisions within the country. Another term could further exacerbate political and social polarization.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]2. **Democratic Norms and Institutions**: Trump has been criticized for challenging democratic norms, such as questioning the integrity of elections and undermining trust in institutions like the media and judiciary. Concerns exist that a second term could weaken democratic institutions further.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]3. **Foreign Relations**: Trump's merica First foreign policy approach has led to strained relationships with traditional allies and international organizations. Critics worry that his return could further isolate the U.S. on the global stage and weaken alliances.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]4. **Climate Change**: Trump has been skeptical of climate change and rolled back numerous environmental regulations. A second term might delay or reverse efforts to address climate change, with potentially long-term global consequences.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]5. **Social and Economic Policies**: Trump's policies on immigration, healthcare, and economic regulation have been controversial. Some fear that another term could lead to policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities and increase inequality.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]6. **Judicial Appointments**: Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices during his first term, shifting the court to a more conservative stance. Another term could allow him to make more judicial appointments, affecting U.S. law for decades.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]7. **Public Health and Science**: During his first term, Trump was criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for downplaying scientific advice. Concerns exist that his approach to public health and science could undermine efforts to address future crises.[CHAR(10)][CHAR(10)]For those who oppose Trump's policies and leadership style, these points highlight potential risks. However, it's essential to note that opinions on Trump's presidency are deeply divided, and some view his policies and approach as beneficial for the country.","Americans face a variety of significant challenges today, which vary in priority depending on personal circumstances and political perspectives.

What is that word you wanna use, she thinks she's got it in the bag. She's acting as if she's president already, as if she's won. i dont hate anybody, but for what she stands for, I don't like her. how she got in is another thing, what biden did in there, right at the end, it was all planned. But, I'm up there in age, hopefully Ill live a little bit longer, these poor kids, these little kids. biden got in there, everything went downhill. /AE/ No.","Everything.

So my opinion, the approach that he's taking, is what his professional education makes him talk like that, and people get offended. But if they put the person aside and listen to what he's trying to do, but because you're putting trump's name on it, oh you're voting for him, I don't give a shit who you're voting for. I also say, when my feidns bring everything up, I am very very, I don't watch TV. I don't know what they're standing for, I don't know anything that's happening, I'm very very... I don't get involved. Because whatever they think and I think, they have their own opinion, and I'm not one to say hy are you doing trump? I realize what has happened. They're voting for the party, and not the person and not listening to what the candidates are standing for. /AE/ I think he should change his hair color, or a toupee that matches a little better, maybe a crew cut. /AE/ And I really really think he has got a gem of a wife.

They don't really care about the people that are going to the bottom, it's only 'how much money can I get out of this'. I think people have lost humanity, you know? They don't care about anybody else, wether you have money or not. It's just awful out there. /AE/ Again I just feel like that humanity inside, this is probably off the beaten path.

I wanted to get up and help him, and I was, but my boyfriend said to wait, but I gotta help to do a little. I just watched how he was determined and how he struggled 10 feet to get to a chair, and how determnined he was. And just as I was about to get up, a guy beside him helped him to get a chair. He impressed me so much, there was another couple that came with him. i said should I or shouldn't I, I said I'm gonna. I stopped and talked to him and told him how much of an example he was. He was determined, he didn't ask for anyone to help him, but that there were two people who came and helped him. You wanna hear the clincher? As i walked away, he started talking to me, and he said I have to tell you, I'm like this because of COVID. How do you like that? You know, sad? Sad sad, you know.

It is destroying the American tax payer who is financing this whole fiasco. /AO/ She is breaking the American tax payer because the tax payer is paying for every thing their medical, their housing, their food and their cell phones. The end result is they want their votes.  There is is a big push in several states to allow illegals to vote.  It's all about money and power. /AO/ Well, people don't understand that all this free stuff that they're giving away to people coming over the border isn't free.  It comes from somewhere.  The government doesn't make it the citizens produce it and the goverenment takes it and gives it away to the illegal immigrants.  We have homeless Americans and vetrans on the streets that could use a hand up and instead we give the illegals a hand out.  /AO/ I don't like the lefts policy on the Green New deal.  It's my opinion that it's a scam. If you do the research on it you'll find out that the studies they use to rove' their global warning is skewed. One study they read","He is a brilliant business man.

I have no issue with immigrants but I have an issue with illegal immigrants. /AO/So We came from [REDACTED LOCATION], I lived in the same house since I was 10 years old.

And I don't know how many people were illegal aliens but when there are that many people living in one house. Like they convert the garage into living quarters and they park the cars. Like one house they have 5 cars and I'd come home from work at12:30 or 1:00 AM in the morning and not be able to park in front of my own house.  /AO/ So, my [REDACTED FAMILY MEMBER] was in [REDACTED DETAILS] and they would often get under bid by companies with immigrants. Because, as I understand it they have so many living in one house that their living costs are less and they can make less.  That's the way I heard it a long time ago, so it's hard. I also think a lot of those people work under the table so they don't pay taxes. /AO/ I think some of the things that haopened to us in our neighborhood happened because of individual people.

With Trump in office and implementing laws against abortion, it feels that women won't have the safe aortion option like they should. They won't have control over their bodies. Just to elaborate on that it kind of feels like women don't have control over their bodies. Especially with them kind of pushing back against roe v wade and stuff like that.

As long as she has a teleprompter, she can't deliver her ideas withou having them scripted. We can go into the debate. Even though she answered her questions straightforward. I have suspicions that she was given the questions to prepare for that debate because it was the first time she didn't get lost answering questions. Her so called economic plans are no more copies of what Trump already put forward. She's like Joe Bide, a plaigarist. She's taking credit for other's work. The border itself is an indication of her lack to perform her job. She claims for the last three and a half years to clean up Donald Trump's mess, and how Trump handed them a bad economy. They seem to forget that Covid was a global epidemic that stalled the economic engine so the jobs lost in the last 8 months of Trump's presidency is due to Covid. When he had to shut down the US economy, it had a massive impact on people's ability to work. This is what the Democrats are running on. There were more people that died from Covid under Joe Biden rather than Donald Trump. Biden and Kamala didn't create jobs, they were just jobs that came back that were already there but stalled by Covid. She says there were no problems at the border, and to try and blame the border issues on someone who tried to fix it, that's someone of no faith. There is no substance to what she says. /AE/ How she got to where she is is incredible, she talks about how she ran on her attorney general but she never prosecuted cases, she hired people to, and one of her cases came back where a man was wrongly accused and imprisoned a man for six years. Then she was in the senate for four years but did nothing, you can look at her voting record. Then she became Vice President. But surprisingly to me how the federal election commission allowed Joe Biden to be elected for the General election yet she along with Chuck Shumer and Nancy Pulosi orchestrated a cois. They took Joe Biden and told him he was going to have to back Kamala or we're going to have to use the 25th ammendment and yank him out. So against his own will, he was pushed out. When Kamala ran for president she didn't have support and now she's up for president. They got rid of J. Biden because the polls showed he was going to lose. When someone is failing in the polls, they're failing in the polls never did I ever see where they pulled out the person who was failing in the polls to put in someone they thought would get more votes. You could go back to Ford v. Carter and he was the Rep. nominee but Ford and they knew he wasn't going to beat Carter and just because he was failing, they didn't pull him out. Joe Biden was the officially elected nominee to run against Donald Trump, but since his failure in the first debate so they replace him. /AE/ During this last debate with a 3 against 1, when she actually told the American people that if he lost it would be a blood bath, to suggest that if D. Trump doesn't win, that it would be a blood bath, what he was refering to was economics. He was talking about economic concequences, because the Democrats are going to keep using the failed policies. Not a blood bath related to a cous, it was a euphanism. But for her to say this is going to be a blood bath, to take that out of context, to me it shows a despreate measure to try and put fear into people by a play on words, given the extreme seriousness that this country is in. This is indicative of how she would run as president. /AE/ She for the last year and a half has boasted that Bidenomics is working, shows just how shallow she is or she's not in touch w/ reality. She was the tie breaker for the American Relief Act, but it had nothing to do with American Relief, it was to help other countries and do very little for Americans. There was very little support for America. They slapped America Relif act on it to make it seem like it was for the American people but it was not. One more thing, they were talking about Hatians coming into this country. Apparently she was responsible for jetting in illegal immigrants instead of coming accross the border. /AE/ When the riots were happening in Seattle, she was for releasing those who were responsible for the riots out in the West. She wanted to go ahead and release them from being held. These people were responsible for a real insurection. That's an insurection. She was protecting those rights for those people. /AE/ In the end there is nothing she has done to remotely try to earn my trust. She's a bonafide marxist. /AE/ No.","He's an outside. He's not beheld to any special interest groups. He has a phenomenal prior 4 year record, had it not been for Covid. He speaks his mind. He took a bullet to the head and he continues to move forward.

In terms of social welfare programs, I'm actually  using one right now that's helping me and I feel that her party.. her policies regarding government assistance programs are more aligned with my views. /AO/Yeah, I feel like she is more respectful to immigrants and those that are not from here, she's more respectful.  /AO/ No","She, I feel she does not care about the nuclear family. She see the family as a threat. I feel her views on systemic racicsm, i do not agree with. I feel she and Joe Biden attribute the  disparity of wealth between the races to systemic racisim. However I believe there are other factors that are causing it. And, Umm, I believe that her views on defund the police, I don't agree with the organization Defund the Police and she has come out many times about defund the police.  Yes and inside of the Democratic Platform the words defund the police are written and I don't vote for a party that supports that. /AO/ Uh Yeah, her views on immigration, I believe she has been way to easy on immigration.  I don't support open borders and I believe in stricter immigration policies than the ones Kamala has discussed. /AO/ Yeah her going back to I believe that Kamala engages in identity polotics, as does Trump, Kamala too. I believe that she could be very devisive for the country. Moving on to her views on transgenderism, and her views on same sex marriage I'm with her and also her views on passing laws against the assault of LGBTQ I'm with her on that.  Could I rephrase it? I agree with her views on same sex marriage and discussing the problem with the assault on gay and lesbian individuals. However, I don't support her views on transgenderism. No that's it. And then for the economy, I felt that the ecomomy was better under Trump and that inflation will go up and prices will continue rising under Kamala.  Additionally, with her views on foreign policy I somewhat dissagree with what she stands for in that regard and somewhat align with Trump on that issue. /AO/ NO","He's really cares about families and the family unit.

The price of everything has gone up exponentially under Joe Biden. And, the focus, the economy, under Joe Biden has been less on the economy and more on other issues that are less important. The bills and policies that Joe Biden and the democratic party have proscribed for the economy, I feel, are weakiening the economy instead of strengthing it. And inflation has gone up so much under his watch, Joe Biden's watch. Additionally the Democratic party likes to spend money on things that hurt the economy. All in All we need the price of everyday goods to go down, we need to bring jobs back to the United States, we need less taxes and a smaller government.  And, we should cut government spending where it is not needed. Additionally we need lower rent costs and housing costs. And, part of it is bringing more jobs here and cutting unnessary spending. I personally never felt a difference except under Joe Biden in terms of the economy.  Everything was super expensive initially and that was more than a reactionary event beccause of Donald Trump's presidency. Because under Donald Trump I was making more money than I ever have and under Obama I wasn't making as much but still the economy under Joe Biden was crazy. Crazy bad. So I think the cost of goods is the number one concern of most Americans and I think the government needs to do some things about that.  /AO/ no",75,70
