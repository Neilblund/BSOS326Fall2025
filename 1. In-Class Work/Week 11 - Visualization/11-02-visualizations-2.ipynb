In the example below, we use f-strings to construct the exact text we want to put on the graph and specify the location of the text using the data coordinates. We want it a little bit offset from the actual mean so that the text isn't right on the line, so we add `5000` to the x-value of the location, then put it sufficiently high up so that it isn't running into any bars. \n",
