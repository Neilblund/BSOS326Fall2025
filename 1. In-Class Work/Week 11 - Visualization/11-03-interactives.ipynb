    "\n",
    "So far, we have only worked with static visualizations. That is, there were no moving pieces or changes that you would make to the graphs after they were made. These are the more traditional visualizations and most commonly used within reports (after all, you can't animate figures on a piece of paper ... at least not yet!).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, now that presentations and reports are distributed and accessed online much more frequently, the use of interactive, dynamic visualizations has grown. Dynamic visualizations can open up a whole new dimension and allow you to show relationships and trends more clearly than with a static visualization. In addition, they can be more flexible and allow for customization of different views of the data much more easily than creating any individual static visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interactive visualizations are typically used for:\n",
    "- Flexible custom views of the data\n",
    "- Creating dashboards and other data tools for non-technical users\n",
    "- Showing a time dimension that would be otherwise difficult to show\n",
    "- Making adjustments in real-time as data comes in\n",
    "- And more ...\n",

    "To start, we'll bring in some datasets to use within our figures."
